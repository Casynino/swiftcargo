 * closed menu labelled in the language they do not speak is the one control
 * that must never hide behind another one.
 *
 * Each label is written in its own language, for the same reason: "中文" is
 * legible to the person who needs it whatever the interface is currently set
 * to, which "Chinese" would not be.
